# Filter presence/absence matrices

The Panaroo algorithm will flag certain clusters if they include potential pseudogenes, genes of unusual length or genes that have been fragmented in the process of assembly or annotation.

- potential pseudo genes will end with the suffix '_stop'
- genes with unusual lengths will end with the suffix '_len'
- fragmented genes will include multiple sequence IDs separated by a semicolon ';'

To filter these sequences out from the presence/absence matrices you can run:

```
panaroo-filter-pa -i ./gene_presence_absence.csv -o ./ --type pseudo,length
```


### Parameters

```
usage: panaroo_filter_pa [-h] -i INPUT_FILE -o OUTPUT_DIR [--type TYPE]
                         [--version]

Filters the Panaroo gene_presence_absence.csv file to exclude sequences
classed as length outliers, pseudo genes or fragmented.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --type TYPE           any combination of 'pseudo', 'length' or 'frag'
                        separated by commas
  --version             show program's version number and exit

Input/output:
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input INPUT_FILE
                        input 'gene_presence_absence.csv' file generated by
                        Panaroo
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --out_dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        location of an output directory
```

### Output

The program will produce new versions of the `gene_presence_absence.csv` and ``gene_presence_absence.Rtab` files with an additional suffix to indicate which kind of filtering has been performed.
